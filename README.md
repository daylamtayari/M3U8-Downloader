# Java M3U8 Downloader

### This is a proof of concept demonstration for the downloading of M3U8 files using Java.   

### **The code itself contains all of the notes, explanations and descriptions.**  

The code itself is well documented and is split in 3 seperate classes:  
- Main class: This class contains all of the user prompts and the method calls to run the program.   
- Downloader class: This class contains all of the methods for downloading and retrieval of the individual chunks from the M3U8 playlist.  
- FileHandler class: This class contains all of the methods that handles the merging of files and the creation of temporary folders.  
  
 **This program should not be implemented into a professional solution as-is.**  
 **It requires minor adaptations for each particular use.**
